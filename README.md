# Echoes ðŸŽ§

*A nostalgic Diwali sound app*

## About

Hi, I built **Echoes** for everyone who canâ€™t make it home during Diwali, including myself. Festivals have a way of feeling quieter when youâ€™re far from the people and places that shaped those memories. Echoes is my way of recreating that feeling through sound.

## What it does

Echoes lets you listen to soundscapes that bring Diwali to life: the crackle of diyas, laughter from balconies, temple bells in the distance, and festive music filling the air. You can mix and match these layers to create your own Diwali vibe, wherever you are.

## Why I made this

I wanted to capture the feeling of being home, not through pictures or videos, but through sound. It feels personal and grounding, a reminder that even if Iâ€™m away, the spirit of Diwali still finds me.

## How to use

1. Open the app.
2. Explore the sound spaces, from calm courtyards to lively neighborhoods.
3. Play, combine, and listen.
4. Let the sounds take you home for a while.

Built as a small experiment in nostalgia and belonging.
If Echoes resonates with you, you already know why I made it.
